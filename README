A Wordle solver of dubious quality and purpose. Great if you like sucking all the fun out of solving puzzles

Usage: ./cheating_at_wordle.py [known letters] [rules] [alphabet]

First argument is the list of letters you already know
Rules are composed of [~][letter]:[position]. The optional tilde indicates a not. for example, a:5 means an 'A' in position 5. ~a:5 means no 'A' in position 5
Alphabet is a comma separated list of letters to exclude from the alphabet

The dictionary lookup works for 5 letter words only. Longer words are possible, but will be exponentially slower

Example:
	./cheating_at_wordle.py -ramo a:1 r:2 ~m:3 ~o:4 ~o:5 e,t,y,u,i,s,d,k,l,c,n,w

	The letters A, E and C are known, 2 letters are not
	Position 1 is an A
	Position 2 is an R
	Position 3 is not an M
	Positions 4 and 5 are not an O
	The word does not contain any of E, T, Y, U, I, S, D, K, L, C, N, or W

	The output will be:
