A Wordle solver of dubious quality and purpose. Great if you like sucking all the fun out of solving puzzles

Usage: ./cheating_at_wordle.py [known letters] [rules] [alphabet]

First argument is the list of letters you already know
Rules are composed of [~][letter]:[position]. The optional tilde indicates a not. for example, a:5 means an 'A' in position 5. ~a:5 means no 'A' in position 5
Alphabet is a comma separated list of letters to exclude from the alphabet

The dictionary lookup works for 5 letter words only. Longer words are possible, but will be exponentially slower

Example:
	./cheating_at_wordle.py aec ~a:2 ~e:2 c:1 r,t,y,u,i,o,s,d,k,l,n,m,z,q,x,w,f,v,g,b,j

	The letters A, E and C are known, 2 letters are not
	Position 1 is a C
	Position 2 is not an A or an E
	The word does not contain any of r, t, y, u, i, o, s, d, k, l, n, m, z, q, x, w, f, v, g, b, or j

	In this case, the most likely answer is CHEAP
